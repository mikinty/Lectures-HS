A regular icosahedron is a $20$-faced solid where each face is an equilateral triangle and five triangles meet at every vertex. The regular icosahedron shown below has one vertex at the top, one vertex at the bottom, an upper pentagon of five vertices all adjacent to the top vertex and all in the same horizontal plane, and a lower pentagon of five vertices all adjacent to the bottom vertex and all in another horizontal plane. Find the number of paths from the top vertex to the bottom vertex such that each part of a path goes downward or horizontally along an edge of the icosahedron, and no vertex is repeated.

 How many ways are there to get from the lower left hand corner to the upper right hand corner of the grid below by only using moves that are right or up?

 I am currently at home ($A$) and I want to make my way to work at $B$. However, I know there is an accident at point $C$ and $D$ in the city, so I want to avoid routes that pass through those places. Taking this into consideration, how many ways can I drive from $A$ to $B$ if I must not pass through $C$ \textit{or} $D$?
 \begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) grid (6,7);
		\node (a) at (-0.2, 0) {$A$}; 
		\node (c) at (2.2, 2.2) {$C$};
		\node (d) at (4.2, 5.2) {$D$};
		\node (b) at (6.2, 7) {$B$};

$^{\ast \ast \ast}$ Dizzy Daisy is standing on the point (0, 0) on the $xy$-plane and is trying to get to the point (6, 6). She starts facing rightward and takes a step 1 unit forward. On each subsequent second, she either takes a step 1 unit forward or turns 90 degrees counterclockwise then takes a step 1 unit forward. She may never go on a point outside the square defined by $\abs{x} \leq 6, \,\, \abs{y} \leq 6$, nor may she ever go on the same point twice. How many different paths may Daisy take?
