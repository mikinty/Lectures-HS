The purpose of this worksheet is to hone in your skills on logarithms and exponents.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Evaluate the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $17^2$
            \item $9^{3}$
            \item $8^{\frac{2}{3}}$
            \item $1.2^{-2}$
            \item $0^{3728}$
            \item $548934^{0}$
            \item $-4^2$
            \item $1^{1.73783^{347}}$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\log_1 1$
            \item $\log_3 9$
            \item $\log_{382} 1$
            \item $\log_4 -3$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Write the following in exponential form (e.g. $\log_2 3 = x$ should be written or ``translated'' into $2^x=3$):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\log_2 8 = y$
        \item $\log_{4.2} a = 65$
        \item $\log_t 8 = y$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A car originally costs \$45,000. I have 40 15\% off coupons I can use repeatedly for the car. What will be the final price of the car after I use all 40 of my coupons? (Hint: the car will end up being rather cheap). Use a calculator to do this problem.
    \item \textit{Extra Credit: Application} A piece of Carbon-10 originally has a mass of $12$ g. After $30.574$ seconds, there is only $4$ g of Carbon-10 left. What is the half-life of Carbon-10? (the half life is the amount of time it takes for an element to have half of its mass decayed). You will need a calculator to do this problem.
